This project focused on the migratory patterns of the local roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_) population using radio-tracking (GPS, VHF) to locate collared animals and define sampling spots. Using a "used-available" design, we collected data on roe deer movement, feeding ecology, and pellet decay rate. We also performed vegetation phenology surveys. Further, I created roe deer migration maps suitable for a lay audience of hunters and farmers using GPS data and Google Maps Engine. I later used these to revamp the project's website, to make it more easily accessible to the general public.
