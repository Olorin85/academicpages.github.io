For my Bachelor of Science Thesis, I lead a computer-based analysis of the bio-acoustics of the Indri lemur (_Indri indri_). These lemurs live in small family groups, and to communicate between different family groups they use complex songs. Working on bioacoustic data collected by fellow lab members in the forests of northern Madagascar, I performed extraction and resampling of sounds from a song. I then analyzed both pitch points and wavelengths to assess whether these songs contain any information on the individual characteristics of each lemur in the family group that could allow researchers to identify them.
