excerpt: 'Ecologists use a variety of methods to count animals in the wild. Often, choosing the 'best' one is tricky. I compared two common techniques to count wildlife, to help researchers make an informed choice.'

In summer 2014, as part of my Master of Research degree at Imperial College London, I designed and performed a study comparing different techniques used in assessing species community composition. I collected my data in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (South Africa), as part of an existing experimental program investigating herbivores response to predation risk and resource availability manipulation. I used a fully-factorial experimental setup, comprised of four sampling plots paired together by type of treatment and habitat composition. Â I visited each plot on a bi-weekly schedule, counting feces with the help of a local guide and collecting photos from camera traps at the same time. Working at close contact with locals, I developed strong bonds with them and learned a lot about both Zulu and South African culture. I also helped some of the fellow researchers present in the park around the same time as me, engaging in plant phenology surveys and lion collaring.
