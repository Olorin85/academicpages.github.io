My research mostly takes place at the interface between Behavioural and Ecosystem Ecology. Currently, I am working on three main themes:

<h2>Animal Physiology and Intra-specific Variability</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Nutrient-based Resource Selection and Space Use</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Food Web Dynamics and Bioenergetics</h2>
<p>
</p>
