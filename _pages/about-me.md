I am in the 4th year of my Ph.D. in the [Ecosystem Ecology Lab](http://shawnleroux.wixsite.com/lerouxlab) at [Memorial University](www.mun.ca/biology).

I am also part of the [Terrestrial Ecology Research Group](https://terrestrialecologyresearchgroup.weebly.com), a group of researchers with expertise from three different disciplines --- Landscape, Wildlife and Ecosystem Ecology --- working together to understand how the boreal forest works and how human activities are affecting it.

I have a BSc in Biology and a MSc in Evolution of Animal and Human Behaviour from the [University of Turin](www.unito.it/en), and a MRes in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation from Imperial College London.
