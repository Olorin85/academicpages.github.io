### !!! Under Construction !!!
<br>
Hi there, and welcome to my website.

My name is Matteo Rizzuto and I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biology](www.mun.ca/biology), at [Memorial University of
Newfoundland](www.mun.ca). I conduct my research in the [Ecosystem Ecology Lab](http://shawnleroux.wixsite.com/lerouxlab), under the supervision of Dr.
Shawn J. Leroux.

I completed a BSc in Biology and a MSc in Evolution of Animal and Human
Behaviour at the [University of Turin](www.unito.it/en). I then enrolled in a
MRes in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Imperial College London, which I
completed with Distinction.

I am also part of the [Terrestrial Ecology Research Group](https://terrestrialecologyresearchgroup.weebly.com), which brings
together researchers with expertise from three different disciplines -
Landscape, Wildlife and Ecosystem Ecology - to answer topical questions about
forest dynamics and human impact.
