Hi! My name is Matteo and I am an ecologist. I study how organisms interactions shape the world around them.

<br>
Welcome to my website!

I am in the 4th year of my Ph.D. in the [Ecosystem Ecology Lab](http://shawnleroux.wixsite.com/lerouxlab) at [Memorial University](www.mun.ca/biology).

I completed a BSc in Biology and a MSc in Evolution of Animal and Human Behaviour at the [University of Turin](www.unito.it/en). I then enrolled in a MRes in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Imperial College London, which I completed with Distinction.

I am also part of the [Terrestrial Ecology Research Group](https://terrestrialecologyresearchgroup.weebly.com), a group of researchers with expertise from three different disciplines --- Landscape, Wildlife and Ecosystem Ecology --- working together to understand how the boreal forest works and how human activities are affecting it.
