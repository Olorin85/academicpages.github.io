# Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Matteo and I am an ecologist. I study how organisms interactions shape the world around them.

My research focuses on how energy, matter, and information shape the interactions between organisms and their environment. I work to expand models of ecosystem functioning, using a mix of field-based and theoretical studies. I do this by measuring exchanges of matter, energy, and information between organisms and their environment, and developing new theoretical models to predict how ecosystems change as a result. My goal is to expand our knowledge of ecosystem functioning, to improve how we predict and mitigate the impact of human activities on our planet.

I am in the 4th year of my Ph.D. in the [Ecosystem Ecology Lab](http://shawnleroux.wixsite.com/lerouxlab) at [Memorial University](www.mun.ca/biology).

I completed a BSc in Biology and a MSc in Evolution of Animal and Human Behaviour at the [University of Turin](www.unito.it/en). I then enrolled in a MRes in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Imperial College London, which I completed with Distinction.

I am also part of the [Terrestrial Ecology Research Group](https://terrestrialecologyresearchgroup.weebly.com), a group of researchers with expertise from three different disciplines --- Landscape, Wildlife and Ecosystem Ecology --- working together to understand how the boreal forest works and how human activities are affecting it.
