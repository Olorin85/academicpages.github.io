# Hi, I'm Matteo and I am an ecologist.
<br>
I study how organisms interactions shape the world around them. Welcome to my
website!

<br>

My research focuses on how energy, matter, and information shape the
interactions between organisms and their environment. I work to expand models
of ecosystem functioning, using a mix of field-based and theoretical studies. I
do this by measuring exchanges of matter, energy, and information between
organisms and their environment, and developing new theoretical models to
predict how ecosystems change as a result. My goal is to expand our knowledge
of ecosystem functioning, to improve how we predict and mitigate the impact of
human activities on our planet.
