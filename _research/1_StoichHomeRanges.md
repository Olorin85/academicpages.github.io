excerpt: 'Food quality varies over space and time in natural systems. Animals respond to this variation by making space use decision. I work with data from a small terrestrial herbivore to test if it varies its home range size with variation in its preferred foods' nutrient content.'

Food varies in its quality over space and time. Animals, faced with this variability in their source of nourishment, may adjust the way they use space to increase their access to high-quality food. I am using predictions of food carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and relocation data snowshoe hares to test whether variation in food quality over space influences home range size of this small herbivore. My co-authors and I used an innovative nutrient distribution model to generate predictions of plant content of key nutrients over the area occupied by our snowshoe hare. We then used linear models to investigate if mean resource quality, or the variability around the mean, can predict home range size. We found that home range size is strongly dependent on the plants' relative content of certain elements, like nitrogen. Our results have strong implications for studies of animals' spatial ecology, as well as for models of ecosystem trophic pathways and conservation and management policies.
